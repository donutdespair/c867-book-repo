 note about pointers:
A pointer is a variable that contains a memory address, rather than containing data like most variables introduced earlier. Appending * after a data type in a variable declaration declares a pointer variable, as in int* myPtr. One might imagine that the programming language would have a type like address in addition to types like int, char, etc., but instead the language requires each pointer variable to indicate the type of data to which the address points. So valid pointer variable declarations are int* myPtr1, char* myPtr2, double* myPtr3, and even Seat* myPtr4; (where Seat is a class type); all such variables will contain memory addresses. - WGU zyBooks C 867: Scripting & Programming 9.2

 note about npos:
 npos is a constant static member value with the greatest possible value for an element of type size_t. This value, when used as the value for a len parameter in stringâ€™s member functions, means until the end of the string. This constant is defined with a value of -1. Since size_t is an unsigned integral type, -1 is the largest possible representable value for this type. To put it simply, think of npos as no-position. As a return value, it is usually used to indicate that no matches were found in the string. Thus, if it returns true, matches were found at no positions (i.e., no matches). - https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-stringnpos-in-cpp

if there's an error about unidentified "i", you probably forgot a curly bracket somewhere
